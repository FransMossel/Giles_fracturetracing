Fracture tracing script in MatLab based on contrast difference, currently only tested on SEM BSE images. To use: run script. Change parameters according to results. Details on the parameters are found in the pdf manual. The script requires the MatLab image processing toolbox.
This is an early version, and (hopefully) a version in Julia will become available!
